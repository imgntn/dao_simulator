Here are some additional simulation-wide steps you might consider adding to your DAOSimulation class:

Proposal expiration: Check if any proposals have exceeded their voting period and, if so, expire them. You can then update the status of expired proposals and process the results (approve or reject).

Project completion: Check if any ongoing projects have reached their completion date. If a project is complete, update its status, release any locked funds, and distribute rewards to the involved parties.

Dispute resolution: If there are any unresolved disputes in the DAO, you can process them during the simulation step. This might involve calling the resolve_dispute method of the Arbitrator agent, updating the involved parties' reputations, and taking any necessary actions based on the dispute's outcome.

Revenue distribution: If your DAO generates revenue, periodically distribute it among members based on their contributions, staked tokens, or other criteria.

Token buyback: If your DAO has a mechanism to buy back its tokens, periodically check the conditions for the buyback and execute it if necessary.

Periodic events: If there are any time-based events that should happen in your DAO, such as a regular meeting, voting cycle, or funding round, implement them as simulation-wide steps.

Agent removal or addition: If agents can enter or leave the DAO over time, implement the necessary logic to handle new members joining or existing members leaving the DAO.
