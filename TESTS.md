## test_integration.py

This test_integration.py file contains an integration test that checks various parts of the DAO simulation to ensure they work together as expected. The test initializes a simulation with a few agents, runs the simulation for 10 steps, and then checks if proposals have been created, agents have voted on proposals, tokens and reputations have been updated, delegators have delegated tokens, and treasury balances have been updated.
